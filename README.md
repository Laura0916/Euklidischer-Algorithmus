# 🔢 Euclidean Algorithm & Extended Euclidean Algorithm

A Java program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm, and also computes the Bézout coefficients using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
This project demonstrates basic algorithmic thinking, recursion/iteration, and console interaction in Java.

##  Features
• 	Computes the GCD of two numbers
• 	Calculates Bézout coefficients (x and y) such that
• 	Simple console input/output
• 	Beginner‑friendly Java structure
